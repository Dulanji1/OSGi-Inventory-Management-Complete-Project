# OSGi-Inventory-Management-Complete-Project

## What is OSGi?
OSGi means Open Services Gateway initiative. OSGi is a framework which allows modular development of applications using java. A Java framework for developing (remotely) deployed service applications that require:
•	Reliability
•	Large scale distribution
•	Wide range of devices
•	Collaborative
•	Created through a collaboration of industry leaders
•	IBM, Ericsson, Nokia, Sony, Telcordia, Samsung, ProSyst,
•	Gatespace, BenQ, Nortel, Oracle, Sybase, Espial, and many more
OSGi containers allow you to break your application into individual modules. (Modules are jar files with additional meta information and called bundles in OSGi terminology).Manage the cross-dependencies between modules. An OSGi framework then offers you dynamic loading/unloading, configuration and control of these bundles - without requiring restarts.
Major Framework vendors: ProSyst, Gate space Telematics, IBM, Siemens, Espial
 Open source implementations: Apache Felix, Eclipse Equinox, Gate space Knopflerfish

## OSGi Life Cycle Layer 
Bundle is started by the Bundle Activator class. Header in the JAR manifest file refer to this class. Bundle Activator interface has 2 methods
•	Start: Initialize and return immediate
•	Stop: Cleanup
•	The Bundle Activator gets a Bundle Context that provides access to the OSGi Framework functions. 
The Framework provides the Start Level service to control the start/stop of groups of applications.

## Project Introduction
I have selected our topic as "Inventory Management System" for our SA assignment1. For this project, we use the OSGi framework and architecture. As well service intercommunication in OSGi Framework, registering services and lifecycle implementation of OSGi bundles.
